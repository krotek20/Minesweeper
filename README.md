# Minesweeper
Minesweeper implementation - C# Windows Forms Application

Project started and finished in March 2019.

The app has a similar structure with the actual game and a little database in background just for recording highscores.

It contains a 20 x 35 board (700 cells) and a total of 99 bombs waiting to be triggered. Using the right click, you can set flags on the cells. This might be helpful to note all the places with (probably) hidden bombs. If you use the left click, you might want to pray, because it triggers the behavior of the pressed cell (a numbered button displaying the bombs around or just a bomb).

There is a timer in the right-down corner. If you win, that's going to be your score!
